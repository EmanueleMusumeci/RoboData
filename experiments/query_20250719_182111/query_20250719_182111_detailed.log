[2025-07-19 18:21:12] [PROMPT] [REMOTE_EXPLORATION] PROMPT:
â”œâ”€â”€ SYSTEM:
â”‚   You are exploring remote knowledge sources to gather relevant data from external sources.
â”‚   
â”‚   The local graph does not contain sufficient information. Use the available remote exploration tools to gather relevant data.
â”‚   
â”‚   USING LOCAL GRAPH DATA:
â”‚   - Review the current local graph data to understand what information is already available
â”‚   - Identify specific gaps and missing entities/relationships that need to be filled
â”‚   - Target your remote exploration to complement existing local data
â”‚   - Avoid gathering redundant information that's already in the local graph
â”‚   - If the graph is too big, only the entities and relationships relevant to the query will be shown
â”‚   
â”‚   EXPLORATION STRATEGY:
â”‚   1. SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE: Use the remote exploration tools to systematically gather data related to the query.
â”‚   2. FOCUS ON RELEVANCE: Prioritize data that contains entities, relationships, or facts related to the query topic.
â”‚   3. COMPLEMENT LOCAL DATA: Focus on filling gaps identified in the local graph data. Start from existing entities and relationships to find new connections and neighboring data.
â”‚   4. USE TOOLS EFFECTIVELY: Execute the remote exploration tools to gather data, ensuring you capture all relevant information.
â”‚   5. AVOID HALLUCINATION: Only gather data that is explicitly available through the remote tools.
â”‚   
â”‚   Your available tools for remote exploration are:
â”‚   		- TOOL get_entity_info: Get structured information about a Wikidata entity, including a human-readable label, a natural language description, and main properties (value-like characteristics of this entity) and relationships with neighboring nodes.USEFUL FOR: getting a detailed info from an entity in Wikidata and its main properties, relationships, and context within the knowledge graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL get_property_info: Get information about a Wikidata property, including its label, description, datatype, and link to the property page.USEFUL FOR: understanding the nature of a property in Wikidata, its type, and how it can be used in queries.
â”‚   		- TOOL search_entities: Search for Wikidata entities by text query with detailed information about the main results. Optionally, you can get the main properties for each entity.USEFUL FOR: finding entities in Wikidata based on a text query, retrieving their main properties. Useful to find a starting point for further exploration of the knowledge graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL sparql_query: Execute SPARQL queries on Wikidata, where SPARQL is a query language for databases, able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.This tool should be preferred if we wish to retrieve sets of data with a common property. It is generally faster than the other tools, as it can retrieve multiple data in a single query.USEFUL FOR: retrieving structured data from Wikidata, such as entities, properties, and relationships.Retrieving data with complex relationships, such as subclasses, superclasses, instances, and properties of entities or even property chains.Retrievin data with specific conditions, such as entities or properties with a certain property value or instances of a class.
â”‚   		- TOOL explore_entity_neighbors: Explore an entity's direct relationships with neighbors or properties/values of this entity that can not represented as other nodes in the graph. USEFUL FOR: understanding the context and connections of an entity within the knowledge graph. Explores the entity's neighbors and properties, returning a structured result.
â”‚   		- TOOL build_local_graph: Get the local graph around an entity up to specified depth, performing a depth-first search (DFS). USEFUL FOR: understanding the local context and relationships of an entity within the knowledge graph with a focus on depth and breadth of connections.
â”œâ”€â”€ USER:
â”‚   Explore remote knowledge sources to answer: "What do you think about climate change?"
â”œâ”€â”€ ASSISTANT:
â”‚   HI! I AM THE ASSISTANT! I PROVIDE USEFUL DATA!
â”‚       PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM THE remote_graph_exploration STAGE:

[2025-07-19 18:21:19] [PROMPT] [REMOTE_EVALUATION] PROMPT:
â”œâ”€â”€ SYSTEM:
â”‚   You are an expert agent evaluating remote data to decide if it's relevant for a user's query.
â”‚   Your main goal is to incrementally build a knowledge graph. You must determine if the gathered remote data, even if incomplete, is related to the query and can contribute to the graph.
â”‚   
â”‚   EVALUATION CRITERIA:
â”‚   - The data does NOT need to directly answer the query but should contribute to building a relevant knowledge graph that might help answer the query in the future.
â”‚   - The data IS RELEVANT if it contains entities, relationships, or facts related to the query topic.
â”‚   - Your task is to collect pieces of information that, step-by-step, will build a graph to answer the query.
â”‚   - SELECT ONLY RELEVANT DATA, DISCARD THE REST
â”‚   
â”‚   USING LOCAL GRAPH DATA:
â”‚   - Compare remote data with the existing local graph to see what's new.
â”‚   - The remote data should complement or expand the local graph.
â”‚   - If the graph is too big, only the entities and relationships relevant to the query will be shown.
â”‚   
â”‚   DECISION CRITERIA:
â”‚   Based on the relevance to the query topic, you must decide:
â”‚   A) The data is relevant and on-topic -> ANSWER "LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE"
â”‚   B) The data is completely irrelevant and off-topic -> ANSWER "EVAL_LOCAL_DATA"
â”‚   C) The data is not sufficient, and you need to explore more remote data -> "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION"
â”‚   
â”‚   You MUST end your response with exactly one of:
â”‚   - "LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE" - Data is relevant and should be added to the graph.
â”‚   - "EVAL_LOCAL_DATA" - Data is not relevant and should be discarded.
â”‚   - "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION" - Not enough data, need more remote exploration.
â”‚   
â”‚   IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN "LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE" or "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION", you should provide a clear explanation of why you think the remote data is relevant, including any changes to the query or tools used.
â”‚   - Evaluation: a summary or evaluation of the current situation and/or the tools executed (tool_name, tool_parameters, why the tool was executed)
â”‚   - Your instructions of what to do next as if they were an order "You should ....", explicitly stating that these instructions should be based on the available tools, which should be listed below as:
â”‚   - tool_name: "tool_description", "explanation of why this tool is needed" USING THE FOLLOWING LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE TOOLS:
â”‚   		- TOOL fetch_node: Fetch a Wikidata entity by ID and add it to the local graph database.USEFUL FOR: fetching entities from Wikidata and adding them to the local graph for further exploration. Minimizes the chance of hallucinations when adding an entity to the local graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL fetch_relationship: Fetch ALL Wikidata statements for a specific property from a subject entity and add them to the local graph database. This tool fetches the subject entity, retrieves all statements for the specified property, then fetches all object entities and creates relationships between the subject and each object in the local graph. USEFUL FOR: comprehensively fetching all relationships of a specific type from Wikidata and adding them to the local graph for exploration. Eliminates hallucinations by only adding relationships that actually exist in Wikidata.
â”‚   		- TOOL remove_node: Remove a node from the graph database by ID
â”‚   		- TOOL remove_edge: Remove an edge from the graph database by ID
â”‚   - A final invitation to use more tools at the same time if necessary
â”‚   - The final choice token
â”œâ”€â”€ USER:
â”‚   Evaluate whether the remote data may be useful for answering: "What do you think about climate change?"
â”œâ”€â”€ ASSISTANT:
â”‚   HI! I AM THE ASSISTANT! I PROVIDE USEFUL DATA!
â”‚       PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM THE eval_remote_data STAGE:
â”‚       <thoughts>
â”‚       LLM_Agent: The local graph is EMPTY. Let's proceed with remote graph exploration to find the necessary information.

ðŸ¤– [2025-07-19 18:21:28] [RESPONSE] [REMOTE_EVALUATION] LLM RESPONSE:
    The remote data contains several entities related to the topic of climate change, including:
    
    1. **climate change (Q125928)**: Describes the change in statistical distribution of weather patterns over an extended period.
    2. **global warming (Q7942)**: Describes the current rise in Earth's average temperature and related shifts in weather patterns.
    3. **climate change adaptation (Q260607)**: Describes the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change and its effects.
    4. **climate change mitigation (Q898653)**: Describes actions to limit climate change to reduce the risks of global warming.
    5. **politics of climate change (Q1774427)**: Describes policy measures to contain global warming.
    6. **climate action (Q22661680)**: Describes actions in the global warming issue.
    7. **climate change litigation (Q29639359)**: Describes legal proceedings meant to address climate change through judicial proceedings.
    
    These entities and their properties are directly relevant to the query about climate change. They provide a broad overview of the topic, including its effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions. This information can contribute significantly to building a knowledge graph that can help answer the query about climate change.
    
    **Evaluation**: The remote data provides a comprehensive set of entities and relationships related to climate change, which are highly relevant to the query. These entities cover various aspects of climate change, including its definition, effects, mitigation, adaptation, political measures, and legal actions.
    
    **You should**:
    - Use the `fetch_node` tool to add the relevant entities such as "climate change," "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation" to the local graph.
    - Use the `fetch_relationship` tool to explore and add relationships for these entities, focusing on properties like "has effect," "handled, mitigated, or managed by," "subclass of," and "part of."
    
    **Tools**:
    - `fetch_node`: "Fetch a Wikidata entity by ID and add it to the local graph database." Useful for adding entities to the local graph for further exploration.
    - `fetch_relationship`: "Fetch ALL Wikidata statements for a specific property from a subject entity and add them to the local graph database." Useful for comprehensively fetching all relationships of a specific type from Wikidata and adding them to the local graph for exploration.

[2025-07-19 18:21:29] [PROMPT] [GRAPH_UPDATE] PROMPT:
â”œâ”€â”€ SYSTEM:
â”‚   Update the local knowledge graph with relevant remote data.
â”‚   
â”‚   CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GRAPH CONSTRUCTION:
â”‚   
â”‚   1. BUILD A CONNECTED GRAPH: Every new entity must be connected to at least one other entity through relationships.
â”‚      Do NOT add isolated nodes unless absolutely necessary.
â”‚   
â”‚   2. RELATIONSHIP-FIRST APPROACH: You should always try to establish new relationships in the local data!!!
â”‚       When you find entities that are related in the remote data:
â”‚      - First add the entities using add_node
â”‚      - Immediately add relationships using add_edge to connect them
â”‚   
â”‚   3. SELECT ONLY RELEVANT DATA:
â”‚      - The remote data should be directly related to the query topic
â”‚      - Focus on entities, relationships, and facts that contribute to building a relevant knowledge graph
â”‚      - Avoid adding irrelevant or off-topic data that does not contribute to the graph's purpose or that is redundant
â”‚   
â”‚   4. PRESERVE DATA STRUCTURE: If the remote data shows relationships between existing entities in the local graph translate them directly into graph relationships. 
â”‚   The local graph should mirror the remote structure as closely as possible. Each local relationship MUST correspond to a remote relationship.
â”‚   
â”‚   5. INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING DATA: 
â”‚      - Review the current local graph data to understand existing structure
â”‚      - Connect new entities to existing entities when relationships exist
â”‚      - Avoid duplicating existing nodes and relationships
â”‚      - Maintain consistency with the existing graph schema
â”‚   
â”‚   6. AVOID HALLUCINATION: Only create relationships that are explicitly present in the remote data.
â”‚      Do not invent relationships that aren't supported by the data.
â”‚   
â”‚   7. WORK SYSTEMATICALLY:
â”‚      a) First, identify useful data in the remote data
â”‚      b) Check if any already exist in the local graph
â”‚      c) Add new entities as nodes with their properties
â”‚      d) Then systematically add all relationships found in the data
â”‚   
â”‚   Your available tools for graph update are:
â”‚   		- TOOL get_node: Get a node from the local knowledge graph by IDUSEFUL FOR: retrieving node details to understand its properties and relationships in the local graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL get_edge: Get an edge from the local knowledge graph by ID.USEFUL FOR: retrieving edges to understand relationships between entities in the local graph. Navigate the local knowledge graph effectively.
â”‚   		- TOOL cypher_query: Execute a Cypher query against the graph database
â”œâ”€â”€ USER:
â”‚   Update the local knowledge graph with relevant remote data for query: "What do you think about climate change?"
â”œâ”€â”€ ASSISTANT:
â”‚   HI! I AM THE ASSISTANT! I PROVIDE USEFUL DATA!
â”‚       PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM THE local_graph_update STAGE:

[2025-07-19 18:21:41] [PROMPT] [LOCAL_EVALUATION] PROMPT:
â”œâ”€â”€ SYSTEM:
â”‚   You are an expert agent evaluating the available data in a local knowledge graph to find information to answer a specific query. 
â”‚       You need to evaluate whether the local data is sufficient to answer the user's query.
â”‚   
â”‚   USING LOCAL GRAPH DATA:
â”‚   - Analyze the current local graph data to understand available entities, relationships, and facts
â”‚   - Determine if this data directly answers the query or provides sufficient context
â”‚   - Consider the completeness and relevance of the local data for the specific question
â”‚   - Base your decision on concrete evidence present in the local graph
â”‚   - If the graph is too big, only the entities and relationships relevant to the query will be shown
â”‚   
â”‚   DECISION CRITERIA:
â”‚   If you have sufficient data -> ANSWER "PRODUCE_ANSWER"
â”‚   
â”‚   If not, decide whether to:
â”‚   A) Give a partial answer with available data -> "PRODUCE_ANSWER"
â”‚   B) Attempt remote graph exploration (if previous attempts allow) -> "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION"
â”‚   C) Go back to local exploration to find more details -> "LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION"
â”‚   
â”‚   You MUST end your response with exactly one of:
â”‚   - "PRODUCE_ANSWER"
â”‚   - "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION"
â”‚   - "LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION"
â”‚   
â”‚   IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN AGAIN "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION", you should provide a clear explanation of why you need to explore remote data, including any changes to the query or tools used.
â”‚   - Evaluation: a summary or evaluation of the current situation and/or the tools executed (tool_name, tool_parameters, why the tool was executed)
â”‚   - Your instructions of what to do next as if they were an order "You should ....", explicitly stating that these instructions should be based on the available tools, which should be listed below as:
â”‚   - tool_name: "tool_description", "explanation of why this tool is needed" USING THE FOLLOWING REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION TOOLS:
â”‚   		- TOOL get_entity_info: Get structured information about a Wikidata entity, including a human-readable label, a natural language description, and main properties (value-like characteristics of this entity) and relationships with neighboring nodes.USEFUL FOR: getting a detailed info from an entity in Wikidata and its main properties, relationships, and context within the knowledge graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL get_property_info: Get information about a Wikidata property, including its label, description, datatype, and link to the property page.USEFUL FOR: understanding the nature of a property in Wikidata, its type, and how it can be used in queries.
â”‚   		- TOOL search_entities: Search for Wikidata entities by text query with detailed information about the main results. Optionally, you can get the main properties for each entity.USEFUL FOR: finding entities in Wikidata based on a text query, retrieving their main properties. Useful to find a starting point for further exploration of the knowledge graph.
â”‚   		- TOOL sparql_query: Execute SPARQL queries on Wikidata, where SPARQL is a query language for databases, able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.This tool should be preferred if we wish to retrieve sets of data with a common property. It is generally faster than the other tools, as it can retrieve multiple data in a single query.USEFUL FOR: retrieving structured data from Wikidata, such as entities, properties, and relationships.Retrieving data with complex relationships, such as subclasses, superclasses, instances, and properties of entities or even property chains.Retrievin data with specific conditions, such as entities or properties with a certain property value or instances of a class.
â”‚   		- TOOL explore_entity_neighbors: Explore an entity's direct relationships with neighbors or properties/values of this entity that can not represented as other nodes in the graph. USEFUL FOR: understanding the context and connections of an entity within the knowledge graph. Explores the entity's neighbors and properties, returning a structured result.
â”‚   		- TOOL build_local_graph: Get the local graph around an entity up to specified depth, performing a depth-first search (DFS). USEFUL FOR: understanding the local context and relationships of an entity within the knowledge graph with a focus on depth and breadth of connections.

â”œâ”€â”€ ASSISTANT:
â”‚   HI! I AM THE ASSISTANT! I PROVIDE USEFUL DATA!
â”‚       PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM THE eval_local_data STAGE:
â”‚       <thoughts>
â”‚       Remote evaluation response: The remote data contains several entities related to the topic of climate change, including:
â”‚   
â”‚   1. **climate change (Q125928)**: Describes the change in statistical distribution of weather patterns over an extended period.
â”‚   2. **global warming (Q7942)**: Describes the current rise in Earth's average temperature and related shifts in weather patterns.
â”‚   3. **climate change adaptation (Q260607)**: Describes the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change and its effects.
â”‚   4. **climate change mitigation (Q898653)**: Describes actions to limit climate change to reduce the risks of global warming.
â”‚   5. **politics of climate change (Q1774427)**: Describes policy measures to contain global warming.
â”‚   6. **climate action (Q22661680)**: Describes actions in the global warming issue.
â”‚   7. **climate change litigation (Q29639359)**: Describes legal proceedings meant to address climate change through judicial proceedings.
â”‚   
â”‚   These entities and their properties are directly relevant to the query about climate change. They provide a broad overview of the topic, including its effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions. This information can contribute significantly to building a knowledge graph that can help answer the query about climate change.
â”‚   
â”‚   **Evaluation**: The remote data provides a comprehensive set of entities and relationships related to climate change, which are highly relevant to the query. These entities cover various aspects of climate change, including its definition, effects, mitigation, adaptation, political measures, and legal actions.
â”‚   
â”‚   **You should**:
â”‚   - Use the `fetch_node` tool to add the relevant entities such as "climate change," "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation" to the local graph.
â”‚   - Use the `fetch_relationship` tool to explore and add relationships for these entities, focusing on properties like "has effect," "handled, mitigated, or managed by," "subclass of," and "part of."

    The local graph data contains several entities related to climate change, including:
    
    1. **climate change (Q125928)**
    2. **global warming (Q7942)**
    3. **climate change adaptation (Q260607)**
    4. **climate change mitigation (Q898653)**
    5. **politics of climate change (Q1774427)**
    6. **climate action (Q22661680)**
    7. **climate change litigation (Q29639359)**
    
    Each of these entities is linked to its corresponding Wikidata page, but the local graph does not contain detailed descriptions or relationships between these entities. The current data provides a list of relevant topics but lacks the depth needed to form a comprehensive answer to the query about climate change.
    
    To provide a meaningful answer, we need more detailed information about these entities, such as their definitions, effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions.
    
    Therefore, I will proceed with further exploration to gather more detailed information about these entities and their relationships.

â”œâ”€â”€ SYSTEM:
â”‚   You are an expert agent exploring a local knowledge graph to find information to answer a specific query.
â”‚   Your task is to systematically explore the available knowledge graph to find relevant information. 
â”‚   
â”‚   
â”‚   USING LOCAL GRAPH DATA:
â”‚   - Local graph data shows existing nodes and relationships
â”‚   - The graph might be empty or incomplete
â”‚   - Use this data to understand what's already in the graph and identify gaps that need to be filled
â”‚   - Build upon existing data when exploring new connections
â”‚   - Avoid redundant exploration of already-known information
â”‚   
â”‚   NOTICE: 
â”‚   If the graph is too big, only the entities and relationships relevant to the query will be shown.
â”‚   In this case you can use the provided tools to explore the graph and gather relevant data.
â”‚   
â”‚   DECISION CRITERIA:
â”‚   After each exploration step, you must decide whether to:
â”‚   A) Continue exploring the local graph because you found promising leads -> ANSWER "LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION" 
â”‚   D) Stop exploring and evaluate what you've found -> ANSWER "EVAL_LOCAL_DATA"
â”‚   
â”‚   Make your decision based on:
â”‚   - Whether you found relevant entities/relationships that warrant further exploration
â”‚   - Whether you have gathered sufficient local information to attempt an evaluation
â”‚   - How the current local graph data relates to your query
â”‚   - The DATA PROVIDED BY THE "ASSISTANT"
â”‚   
â”‚   You MUST end your response with exactly one of:
â”‚   - "LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION" - Continue local exploration
â”‚   - "EVAL_LOCAL_DATA" - Ready for evaluation of the data contained in the local graph
â”‚   
â”‚   IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN AGAIN "REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION" or "LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION", you should provide a clear explanation of why you need to explore remote data, including any changes to the query or tools used.
â”‚   - Evaluation: a summary or evaluation of the current situation and/or the tools executed (tool_name, tool_parameters, why the tool was executed)
â”‚   - Your instructions of what to do next as if they were an order "You should ....", explicitly stating that these instructions should be based on the available tools, which should be listed below as:
â”‚   - tool_name: "tool_description", "explanation of why this tool is needed" USING THE FOLLOWING LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION TOOLS:
â”‚   		- TOOL get_node: Get a node from the local knowledge graph by IDUSEFUL FOR: retrieving node details to understand its properties and relationships in the local graph.

â”‚       PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM THE local_graph_exploration STAGE:
â”‚       <thoughts>
â”‚       Local exploration response: The local knowledge graph contains several entities related to climate change, such as "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation." However, these entities are only linked to their corresponding Wikidata pages without detailed descriptions or relationships between them.
â”‚   
â”‚   To provide a comprehensive answer to the query about climate change, I need to gather more detailed information about these entities, such as their definitions, effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions.
â”‚   
â”‚   ### Evaluation:
â”‚   - The local graph data contains entities related to climate change but lacks detailed information.
â”‚   - To answer the query effectively, I need to explore these entities further to understand their properties and relationships.
â”‚   
â”‚   ### Instructions:
â”‚   You should use the following tools to explore the local knowledge graph further:
â”‚

    The local knowledge graph contains several entities related to climate change, such as "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation." However, these entities are only linked to their corresponding Wikidata pages without detailed descriptions or relationships between them.
    
    To provide a comprehensive answer to the query about climate change, I need to gather more detailed information about these entities, such as their definitions, effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions.
    
    ### Evaluation:
    - The local graph data contains entities related to climate change but lacks detailed information.
    - To answer the query effectively, I need to explore these entities further to understand their properties and relationships.
    
    ### Instructions:
    You should use the following tools to explore the local knowledge graph further:
    
    - **cypher_query**: "Execute a Cypher query against the graph database" to gather more detailed information about the entities related to climate change. This tool is needed to explore the properties and relationships of the entities in the local graph.
    
    Feel free to use more tools at the same time if necessary.

    The local knowledge graph contains several entities related to climate change, such as "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation." However, these entities are only linked to their corresponding Wikidata pages without detailed descriptions or relationships between them.
    
    To provide a comprehensive answer to the query about climate change, I need to gather more detailed information about these entities, such as their definitions, effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions.
    
    ### Evaluation:
    - The local graph data contains entities related to climate change but lacks detailed information.
    - To answer the query effectively, I need to explore these entities further to understand their properties and relationships.
    
    ### Instructions:
    You should use the following tools to explore the local knowledge graph further:
    
    - **cypher_query**: "Execute a Cypher query against the graph database" to gather more detailed information about the entities related to climate change. This tool is needed to explore the properties and relationships of the entities in the local graph.
    
    Feel free to use more tools at the same time if necessary.

ðŸ¤– [2025-07-19 18:22:47] [RESPONSE] [LOCAL_EXPLORATION] LLM RESPONSE:
    The local knowledge graph contains several entities related to climate change, such as "global warming," "climate change adaptation," "climate change mitigation," "politics of climate change," "climate action," and "climate change litigation." However, these entities are only linked to their corresponding Wikidata pages without detailed descriptions or relationships between them.
    
    To provide a comprehensive answer to the query about climate change, I need to gather more detailed information about these entities, such as their definitions, effects, mitigation strategies, adaptation processes, and related political and legal actions.
    
    ### Evaluation:
    - The local graph data contains entities related to climate change but lacks detailed information.
    - To answer the query effectively, I need to explore these entities further to understand their properties and relationships.
    
    ### Instructions:
    You should use the following tools to explore the local knowledge graph further:
    
    - **cypher_query**: "Execute a Cypher query against the graph database" to gather more detailed information about the entities related to climate change. This tool is needed to explore the properties and relationships of the entities in the local graph.
    
    Feel free to use more tools at the same time if necessary.
