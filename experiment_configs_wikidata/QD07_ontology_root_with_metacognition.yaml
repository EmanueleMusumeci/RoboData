    system_description: >
      An AI-powered ontology exploration framework where a metacognitive LLM agent monitors
      and corrects the execution history of a multi-stage LLM-based orchestrator.
      The metacognitive system provides strategic assessment and meta-observation capabilities
      to improve query processing performance through behavioral analysis
      and strategic suggestions for the primary orchestrator agent.
    
    agent_description: >
      Multi-stage orchestrator with six distinct execution phases:
      (1) LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION using graph database tools (GetNodeTool, CypherQueryTool, GetEdgeTool) to search the accumulated local knowledge graph,
      (2) EVAL_LOCAL_DATA using evaluation tools to assess local search results,
      (3) REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION using Wikidata API tools (GetEntityInfoTool, SearchEntitiesTool, SPARQLQueryTool, NeighborsExplorationTool, LocalGraphTool) to fetch data from the Wikidata ontology,
      (4) EVAL_REMOTE_DATA using evaluation tools to assess remote retrieval results,
      (5) LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE using graph update tools (FetchNodeTool, FetchRelationshipTool, RemoveNodeTool) to populate the local knowledge graph with validated remote data,
      (6) PRODUCE_ANSWER using evaluation tools to generate final responses with supporting evidence from the accumulated graph.
    
    task_description: >
      Systematically explore the Wikidata ontology
      through strategic tool usage to populate a local knowledge graph
      that can answer natural language queries.
      Each answer must be supported by a comprehensive set of nodes
      and relationships from the accumulated local knowledge graph,
      providing complete provenance and evidence chains
      for every statement in the response.
      The resulting graph should be as connected as possible. Avoid isolated nodes and ensure all relevant information is linked.
      NOTICE: IN WIKIDATA RELATIONS ARE DIRECTED, SO THE GRAPH WILL BE DIRECTED AS WELL. SO RELATIONS ARE NOT SYMMETRICAL. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS WHEN EXPLORING THE ONTOLOGY.
      ONLY WRITE THE MOST IMMEDIATE TASK TO PERFORM.
