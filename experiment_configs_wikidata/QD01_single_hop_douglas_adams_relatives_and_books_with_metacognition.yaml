    system_description: >
      An AI-powered ontology exploration framework where a metacognitive LLM agent monitors
      and corrects the execution history of a multi-stage LLM-based orchestrator.
      The metacognitive system provides strategic assessment and meta-observation capabilities
      to improve query processing performance through behavioral analysis
      and strategic suggestions for the primary orchestrator agent.
    
    agent_description: >
      Multi-stage orchestrator with six distinct execution phases:
      (1) LOCAL_GRAPH_EXPLORATION using graph database tools (GetNodeTool, CypherQueryTool, GetEdgeTool) to search the accumulated local knowledge graph,
      (2) EVAL_LOCAL_DATA using evaluation tools to assess local search results,
      (3) REMOTE_GRAPH_EXPLORATION using Wikidata API tools (GetEntityInfoTool, SearchEntitiesTool, SPARQLQueryTool, NeighborsExplorationTool, LocalGraphTool) to fetch data from the Wikidata ontology,
      (4) EVAL_REMOTE_DATA using evaluation tools to assess remote retrieval results,
      (5) LOCAL_GRAPH_UPDATE using graph update tools (FetchNodeTool, FetchRelationshipTool, RemoveNodeTool) to populate the local knowledge graph with validated remote data,
      (6) PRODUCE_ANSWER using evaluation tools to generate final responses with supporting evidence from the accumulated graph.
    
    task_description: >
      Systematically explore the Wikidata ontology
      through strategic tool usage to populate a local knowledge graph
      that can answer natural language queries.
      Each answer must be supported by a comprehensive set of nodes
      and relationships from the accumulated local knowledge graph,
      providing complete provenance and evidence chains
      for every statement in the response.
